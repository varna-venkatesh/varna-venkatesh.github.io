		<p1>I have many employability and transferable sources that make me an effective candidate.</p1>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h3><span style="background-color: #9EB179"><b>Employability Skills</span></b></h3>
		<br>
		<p1><span style="background-color: #9EB179"><b>Research:</b></span> As a biomedical engineering professor, one would have to conduct research. Being able to follow scientific procedure and investigate information to create new concepts and solutions is a large part of the work of a biomedical engineering professor.</p1>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p1><span style="background-color: #9EB179"><b>Teaching:</b></span> Teaching is an essential skill for a biomedical engineering professor. One would have to teach a certain amount of classes every year and being an effective teacher would be very helpful. This involves being able to clearly explain concepts to students, answer questions, speak to large audiences, mark exams, deal with administrative tasks, create and maintain course materials, instruct and work with TAs, and more.</p1>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p1><span style="background-color: #9EB179"><b>Programming:</b></span> Programming can be a very useful skill for biomedical engineering professors. To create software and models for solutions, being able to program in a variety of languages such as MATLAB and Python can be useful. Being able to program means that one would be able to plan out the solution to a problem and program an algorithm to solve it.</p1>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p1><span style="background-color: #9EB179"><b>Designing (CAD):</b></span> Being able to CAD is an important skill for biomedical engineering professors. One may have to design physical products such as prosthetics or circuit boards. Being able to CAD would mean that one could sketch out a design and create 3D features. A proficiency in CAD would help with these tasks.</p1>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p1><span style="background-color: #9EB179"><b>Analysis:</b></span> As a biomedical engineering professor, analysis would be a paramount skill. I would need to be able to analyse data in order to conduct research. For example, I may need to analyse signals when working on a solution revolving the cardiovascular system. Being able to interpret the data will aid me in solving problems and creating solutions.</p1>

		<h3><span style="background-color: #9EB179"><b>Transferable Skills</span></b></h3>
		<br>
		<p1><span style="background-color: #9EB179"><b>Communication:</b></span> As a biomedical engineering professor, one would have to communicate with many different groups of people. One would have to communicate with other professors, course students, Masters and PhD students, collaborators from industries, administration at the university, and more. Being able to communicate with people of various ages, education, and backgrounds is very important.</p1>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p1><span style="background-color: #9EB179"><b>Organisation:</b></span> Organisation is a very important transferable skill for biomedical engineering professors. One would have many resources, books, and papers that they would have to keep organised in a physical environment. One would also need to keep track of files and information in a digital environment. Organisation can help one become more efficient.</p1>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p1><span style="background-color: #9EB179"><b>Troubleshooting:</b></span> Troubleshooting is a critical skill for biomedical engineering professors. Things always go wrong, whether modelling, programming, researching, or working in labs. Being able to methodically search for problems and try to solve them can be very useful.</p1>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p1><span style="background-color: #9EB179"><b>Learning:</b></span> The real world is constantly changing, and being knowledgeable about new information is essential for biomedical engineering professors. The problems and cases that they are working on would be constantly changing, and being able to learn from others in the field is paramount. One could learn through experiences such as conferences, reading papers, and meetings.</p1>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p1><span style="background-color: #9EB179"><b>Writing:</b></span> Being a good writer is important for a biomedical engineering professor. One would have to write papers and complete grant and award applications. This requires a high level of grammar and writing proficiency. Additionally, communicating with others involves writing, which means that one must be a good writer.</p1>
