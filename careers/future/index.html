		<h3><span style="background-color: #9EB179"><b>What do my job prospects look like?</span></b></h3>
		<br>
		<p1> There are 95 universities in Canada, which means that there are a lot of opportunities for me to be able to receive a job as a professor. Biomedical engineering is becoming a very popular degree, especially as a pathway to medicine. Therefore, the level of demand for biomedical engineering professors would be very high, especially in the future.</p1>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p1>If I was not able to get a position as a professor at first, I would enter the industry until I am able to become a professor. Some provinces have very good outlooks for biomedical engineers, such as Nova Scotia, Ontario, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. Others have moderate outlooks such as Alberta, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Prince Edward Island. Across Canada, my wage would range from $26.44 to $44.00 to $75.00 per hour if I worked as a biomedical engineer. Since I have a PhD, I would get higher pay because of my qualifications.</p1>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p1>With this information in mind, I immersed myself in both industry and academic opportunities throughout my university career. This means that I can pivot to either type of job opportunity and present relevant experience for both.</p1>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p1>To get a position after I graduate, I would apply to open positions for assisstant professors. I would find said positions on university websites or on general job websites.</p1>
		<br>

		<h3><span style="background-color: #9EB179"><b>What am I looking for?</span></b></h3>
		<br>
		<p1>As an assistant professor, I am looking for a salary between $71 027 and $122 330. If I become an associate professor, I would look for a minimum salary of $87 154. If I become a professor, I would look for a minimum salary of $117 007.</p1>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p1>I would expect an indoors working environment at the university. This would include spaces such as lecture halls, offices, and labs. I would expect to work 5 days a week, 8 hours a day. I would also expect a flexible working schedule, except for class times.</p1>

		<p1>My <span style="background-color: #9EB179"><b>daily tasks</b></span> would include:</p1>
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li><p1>Teaching courses</p1></li>
			<li><p1>Marking exams</p1></li>
			<li><p1>Conduct research with industry partners</p1></li>
			<li><p1>Mentor Masters and PhD students</p1></li>
			<li><p1>Write and publish papers</p1></li>
			<li><p1>Present at conferences and to industry partners</p1></li>
			<li><p1>Administration</p1></li>
			<li><p1>Secure grants and contracts</p1></li>
