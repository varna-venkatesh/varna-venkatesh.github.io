	<h3><span style="background-color: #9EB179"><b>University</span></b></h3>
	<br>
	<p1>I did a Bachelor of Applied Science (BASc) in Engineering Science (Biomedical Systems Engineering) at University of Toronto. I did the 4 year program without PEY Co-op (1 additional year). After this, I completed a Masters of Applied Science in Engineering and PhD with Dr. Name.
	<br>
	<br>
	<p1><span style="background-color: #9EB179"><b>How did I get in?</b></span></p1>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p1>I took 6 4U/M courses including Advanced Functions (MHF4U), Calculus & Vectors (MCV4U), Chemistry (SCH4U), English (ENG4U), Physics (SPH4U), and one additional U or M course.</p1>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p1>I had to complete a supplemental application, which was an Online Student Profile. This included a list of my extracurricular activities. Then, I had to complete the Personal Profile, which consisted of one 250 word response in 10 minutes, one 2 minute video response with two minutes for preparation, and one 3 minute video response with three minutes for preparation.</p1>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p1><span style="background-color: #9EB179"><b>What were some barriers that I faced?</b></span></p1>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p1>Some barriers that I faced during my university experience include an intensive course load, difficult course material, limited internships and research positions, and limited Masters positions.</p1>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p1><span style="background-color: #9EB179"><b>Intensive course load:</b></span> Engineering Science features 6 courses per semester, and they are fixed courses in Years 1 and 2. This means that I had to do a lot of different subjects in one semester and I had a lot of labs, assignments, and tests.</p1>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p1>I overcame this by planning well and using strategies to help me succeed such as the Pomodoro Technique and time blocking. I took courses in the summer to reduce my workload in Years 2 to 4.</p1>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p1><span style="background-color: #9EB179"><b>Difficult course material:</b></span> Engineering science has fixed courses in Years 1 and 2. In these courses, students explore a wide variety of subjects, such as quantum mechanics and material sciences. Due to the vast amount of material covered, I had to study very many difficult concepts.</p1>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p1>I overcame this challenge by using different studying techniques to ensure that I understand all of the concepts. I used techniques such as spaced repetition and active recall. I also overcame this problem by effectively using my time and using techniques to help me focus like the Pomodoro Technique.</p1>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p1><span style="background-color: #9EB179"><b>Getting internships and research positions:</b></span> Due to the large number of engineering students that are looking for internships and research opportunities, it can be hard to get a position during the summer.</p1>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p1>I solved this problem by cold emailing professors in advance. This ensured that the professors had enough time to see my email, and that I was emailing earlier than other competitors. I also did this in the industry. I also arranged to meet with professors in the field that I was interested in, so that they knew of me and knew that I was interested in collaborating with them.</p1>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p1><span style="background-color: #9EB179"><b>Getting a Masters position:</b></span> It can be difficult to procure a Masters position as the number of positions depends on the funding of the university and the professors. If the professor did not receive a lot of money, they would not be able to hire a lot of students.</p1>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p1>To mitigate this problem, I made meaningful connections with my professors and professors in the field that I was interested in. This ensured that they knew who I am and were more inclined to choose me. I also participated in a variety of extracurriculars throughout my university career and achieved a high enough GPA to be on the Deanâ€™s List. Additionally, I cold-emailed professors in addition to completing the application to show my interest. If I did not procure a Masters position, I had planned to work in the industry for a year and reapply. The advantage is that I would have a year of experience in the real world, which could improve my chances of receiving a position.</p1>
